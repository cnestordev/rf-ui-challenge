## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This script installs all the necessary dependencies for the project, making sure that everything is set up correctly. To run it, simply navigate to the project directory in your terminal and type npm install.

### `npm start`

This script launches the project in development mode and opens it in your default browser. You can access it at http://localhost:3000. Whenever you make changes to the code, the page will automatically refresh. If you encounter any errors, you can check the console for more information.

### `SASS`

This project uses SASS to make it easier to manage the CSS styling. If you need to make changes to the SASS files, you'll need a compiler to turn them into CSS. For this project, I recommend using the free VS Code extension called Live Sass Compiler. You can find it at the following link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass

### `npm run build`

This script builds the project for production mode, optimizing the code and making it ready for deployment. The final product will be located in the build folder, which you can access by running the command npm run build. The filenames in this folder will include hashes, and the code will be minified to ensure the best possible performance.

By using these scripts, you'll be able to work with this project effectively and efficiently. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or run into any issues.
